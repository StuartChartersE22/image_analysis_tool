# Image Analysis Tool
The user can submit an image URL (file submission currently not working) to the web app and select wheather a face recognition or classification analysis is performed. Future plan is to use the pixel location to draw boxes around faces and link them to the information rather than printing out the coordinates. File submission is currently broken. The file source needs to be sorted to submit from the server.

API used for the image analysis is IBM Visual Recognition API (https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/visual-recognition) powered by Watson.
